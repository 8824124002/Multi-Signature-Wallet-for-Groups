## Project Title
**Watch NFT Marketplace**

## Project Description
The Watch NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs representing watches. These NFTs are unique and can be traded between users, making it a secure and transparent platform for trading digital collectibles.

This contract allows users to create their own NFTs (representing watches), set a price for them, and transfer them to new owners by making payments. The marketplace aims to bring the world of luxury watch collectibles into the digital world by leveraging the power of blockchain technology.


## Project Vision
The vision for the Watch NFT Marketplace is to create a decentralized platform that allows users to buy, sell, and trade NFTs representing watches. By utilizing blockchain technology, we can ensure the uniqueness, scarcity, and ownership history of each watch NFT. The platform will eventually evolve to support a broader range of collectibles, making it a leading marketplace for digital luxury items.

## Future Scope
The future development of this project could include:
- **Auction Mechanism**: Enabling users to auction their NFTs, allowing the market to set the price dynamically.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Development of a front-end application that allows users to interact with the smart contract seamlessly.
- **Metadata Support**: Storing detailed metadata for each watch NFT, such as images, descriptions, and history.
- **Royalties**: Implementing royalties for creators, ensuring they receive a percentage of each resale transaction.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Integrating with other NFT marketplaces like OpenSea to allow trading across multiple platforms.

## Key Features
- **Minting NFTs**: Users can create NFTs representing unique watches by specifying a name and a price.
- **Buy/Sell Transactions**: Users can purchase NFTs from others by paying the price set by the current owner.
- **Ownership Transfer**: The contract handles the secure transfer of NFTs between users when a payment is made.
- **Event Logging**: Transactions are logged through events, making it easy to track the creation and transfer of NFTs on the blockchain.
